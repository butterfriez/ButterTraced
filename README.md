This repository contains an LWJGL (Light Weight Java Game Library) engine that serves as the backend for raytraced games. The engine is designed to utilize the power of NVIDIA RTX series GPUs for efficient and realistic raytracing.

## Tutorial Series

The engine is developed following a tutorial series available on YouTube. The tutorial series provides step-by-step guidance on building a raytraced game engine using LWJGL. You can access the tutorial series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTJZpRK_oNo&list=PL4QbKfRYvHvSJSVgHawYIvcIA0CcgnMzw&index=3).

## Features

The LWJGL engine for raytraced games offers the following features:

- Raytracing capabilities leveraging the power of NVIDIA RTX series GPUs.
- Lightweight and efficient game engine architecture.
- Java-based implementation using LWJGL for cross-platform compatibility.
- Support for real-time rendering of complex scenes with accurate lighting and reflections.
- Integration with shaders and compute shaders for advanced rendering techniques.
- Convenient API for managing game entities, input handling, and physics simulations.
